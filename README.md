Description: basically calculator that can do addition, substraction, multiplication and division. in my project i wrote codes for each function like for division or addition, all with very similar lines of code. i used arrays, if, 
kknowledge i had about coding. when program starts you choose what function should calculator do, for example if you want to do multiplication you type "m" and enter. you can also quit by typing "q", which basically returns to 0. once you 
choose your function you need to choose 2 number to do that function, for example now we chose multiplication so if we choose 2 numbers like 3 and 4 we get 12 as the answer which is correct. after that you either countinue and add another  number
or type "n" and return to main lobby. this is all about my project. hope it's good, and goodbye.
